# Hard-Exudate-Segmentation-using-IDRiD-Retina-image-dataset-Images
Hard Exudate Segmentation (Hex) - is a segmentation algorithm to automatically segment hard exudate from retina images (IDRiD dataset) to enable early detection of diabetic retinopathy. 
Challenges: Very heterogeneous lesions, and uneven illumination conditions.
Disclaimer: The results of this project are not up to the current state of the art and can be improved. Other methods to explore include superpixel segmentation or mean shift segmentation.
